Being part of an agile team requires coding and eventually reviewing code from others.

### Code organization
In order to make it easier to switch between my code and some code to be reviewed, I maintain multiple clones of the repository.

These clones will be located under a short name representative of the project and then have names like either `main` or `review`.

``` js
.
├── been-there
│   ├── main
│   └── review
├── mock-location
│   ├── main
│   └── review
└── espresso-tips
    ├── main
    └── review
```

### Shell enhancements
A few aliases on my _.zshrc_ allow to quickly jump between those different locations. The pattern I usually apply for the alias  consists of 4 letters, where the third is meaningful to indicate the project, and the fourth indicates either `main` or `review`.

_cdbm_=`cd ~/Code/been-there/main`

_cdbr_=`cd ~/Code/been-there/review`

#### Git aliases
To make it easier to fetch, pull, checkout, and all other commands we normally use in Git, I rely on some plugins for [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh).

My list of [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) include:

- git
- git-extras
- git-flow
- git-flow-avh
- git-prompt
- git-remote-branch
- github
- gitignore

These plugins add some aliases to my shell and I can easily perform change between branches, cleanup my repo, and approve those PRs.

These are a few of the ones I use the most:

*glola* = `'git log --graph --pretty='\''%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'\'' --all'`

*gco* = `git checkout`

*gfa* = `git fetch --all --prune`

*gup* = `git pull --rebase`

*gb* = `git branch`

*gc* = `git commit -v`

To cleanup repos that I eventually checked-out:

`gco -- . && gco master && gb -l | grep -v ^\* | xargs git branch -D`
